Analyze the provided PDF as a potential radiology examination report. Answer each question with only 'Yes' or 'No' followed by one concise sentence of explanation. Base answers strictly on explicit evidence in the document. Follow these guidelines: 
 
Part A 
1. Is the PDF a radiology examination report? 
   - Confirm only if both title and content align with radiology standards (e.g., sections like Findings/Impression). Reject if content is unrelated (e.g., referrals, prescriptions).

1. Does the title align with radiology? 
   - Check only the title (e.g., terms like "X-ray," "MRI," "CT"). Ignore content. 
   - Example: A title "CHEST XRAY" with non-radiology content still answers Yes here. 
 
2. Is the content consistent with radiology?
